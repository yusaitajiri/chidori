# Changelog

All notable changes are listed here. Versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/); `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` holds the current version.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - 2026-10-25

0.5.0 was built but never published. Its changes are all here.

### Added

- Transcribe an audio or video file you already have: 「ファイルから文字起こし」 under 開始, or drop the file on the window. Anything Windows plays works (MP4, MOV, MKV, WebM, M4A, MP3, WAV, FLAC, WMA), and Opus. It runs as fast as the PC keeps up, shows how far into the file it has got, and saves a session named after the file whose times are places in the file.
- Delete the session you are reading from its ⋯ menu, and copy a session straight from its row in 履歴.

### Changed

- A session has the same ⋯ menu wherever it is shown: open, or as a row in 履歴.
- コピー has a ▾ beside it for 「Agent用にコピー」 and 「Markdownでコピー」, which used to be in ⋯.
- Projects are managed in 履歴: pick a project in the filter and the page becomes that project's, with a ⋯ to change its name and colour or delete it. 設定 › プロジェクト is gone.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-10-19

0.4.0 was built but never published: its sound did not play back. Its changes are all here.

### Added

- The setup wizard's shortcut step sets the shortcuts, or leaves them off.
- While recording, words still on their way show 「文字起こし中…」 with a spinner, so a slow PC no longer looks stuck; 仕上げ中 has a spinner too.

### Changed

- Kikitori is now Chidori. Updating from Kikitori removes the old install and brings your settings, models and recordings along (`Documents\Kikitori` becomes `Documents\Chidori`).
- A new look from the kamon brand: a warm grey ground, the plover crest as the icon, Zen Kaku Gothic New, and Chidori's 朱 for buttons and the voice you hear. 開始 is a round button with the record dot, and errors and warnings come on brick and ochre with their words.
- The tray icon is ink while idle and takes its colour while recording.
- PDFs use the same ink and 朱, with a double rule under the title.
- The window opens expanded until you shrink it.

### Fixed

- When transcription fell behind, echo of 相手 in a long 自分 line could be kept as 自分's words.
- A saved session's sound plays back in the installed app, and each press that cannot open the file says so.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added

- A minute behind, a banner offers to transcribe after Stop: Whisper stops while recording so a slow PC keeps up, and the speech is written, 相手 and 自分 still apart, when you stop. 今すぐ再開 on the line takes it up again.
- Finishing that takes more than 5 s shows a progress bar.

### Changed

- 「遅れ n秒」 sits on the line, where it fits in both windows (the buttons added in 0.2.0 had squeezed it out), and turns bold from 15 s and yellow from 30 s.
- 設定 › モデル lists the recommended models and the ones you have; the others open from ほかのモデル.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- A star button while recording marks the line being said as important, even before its text arrives; any line's star adds or removes the mark later. Exports and copies start important lines with ★, and the prompt for AI agents explains it.
- Hotkeys for the important mark and the cut.
- Switch the source while recording, without stopping; the transcript notes the switch.
- The recording keeps a header with its title (click to rename) and its source.
- The camera's menu picks what screenshots take: the app's window, a screen, all screens, or any open window.
- Recordings keep their sound (Opus, about 11 MB an hour): play a finished session back from any line, with the line and the session's line following the sound.
- 続きを録音 records more onto a saved session, today's or an old one, keeping its clock times true.
- Projects group recordings under a name and a colour; History filters by project, and Markdown front matter names it.
- A cut button while recording starts a new part of the session. The transcript shows the cut, Markdown exports head each part with `## HH:MM:SS`, and the PDF lists the parts in its outline.

### Changed

- 最新へ jumps straight to the newest line when it is far away, instead of gliding there for seconds in a long session.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- Live transcription with local Whisper (whisper.cpp), on the GPU through Vulkan with CPU fallback. Japanese and English come out as spoken, whichever language is set, never translated.
- Sources: one app's audio (Windows 11), all system audio, and the microphone, labelled 相手 and 自分, with an echo guard for speakers. The source picker shows each app's live sound beside its name while it plays.
- Screenshots by hotkey or button, placed in the transcript where they were taken.
- Sessions saved as Markdown with images, recovered after a crash, and kept in a searchable history grouped by day, with line editing and moving several to the Recycle Bin at once.
- A small window in white, black and one red that follows the Windows light or dark theme, with a pin to keep it on top. A red dot starts a line drawn from the live sound, 相手 above and 自分 below, under a transcript grouped into speaker turns, with pause/resume, stop and screenshot controls. Each finished session keeps the shape of its sound as a timeline to jump through and as its picture in the history.
- Copy as plain text, Markdown or a prompt for AI agents; export, each saved where you choose, to Markdown (a folder or a ZIP with the images), PDF typeset with Typst in Yu Gothic, and the Typst file itself to edit.
- Model manager with resumable, checksum-verified downloads and a 10-second speed benchmark.
- Setup wizard, tray menu, global hotkeys (off until you set them), Japanese and English UI; the first launch follows the Windows display language.
- App icon and logo: a red bird (kiki-tori; とり is a bird) whose outline ripples out in fading waves. In the tray the ripples show only while recording (grey while paused or finishing); the title bar shows the kikitori logo, with the bird as its o, and the PDF footer carries the bird.
- Daily update check that asks before installing (active once updater keys are set up).
- NSIS installer that installs per user without admin rights and bundles the Vulkan loader.
